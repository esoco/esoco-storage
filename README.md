# The esoco-storage project

This project contains the esoco-storage library which offers a simple but powerful API to implement object persistence. The generic API not only supports JDBC-based relational persistence engines but can also be easily adapted to other persistence concepts or back-ends. It provides direct persistence for arbitrary Java objects (POJOs) without the need for configuration other than defining the actual database connection. It is built on the ObjectRelations framework and the functional programming framework therein. Predicates from the latter are used for the definition of query criteria in a fluent way.
